# taxi-v3-openai-gym
 This repository has a script implementing a reinforcement learning agent using the Q-learning algorithm in Gym's "Taxi-v3" environment. In "Taxi-v3," a taxi must pick up and drop off passengers at specific locations in a grid. The agent's goal is to learn an optimal policy for completing this task efficiently.
